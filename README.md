# epke-solver
Exact Point Kinetics Equations (EPKE) solver with quadratic approximation of integration of the precursor equations.

Forked from [esgonzales/epke-solver](https://github.com/esgonzalez/epke-solver).

Updated to add the ability to perform uncertainty quantification from kinetics data (delayed neutron fractions, decay constants) to safety parameters for a reacitivty insertion accident (e.g. peak fuel enthalpy).
